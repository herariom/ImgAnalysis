# ImgAnalysis

A proof of concept image recognition library made in pure Java. It uses the depth first search algorithm to find similarly colored fragments in the main image that can be compared with the subject image to detect how similar the two images are.

See my [website](https://herariom.github.io) for an example of this library in use.
